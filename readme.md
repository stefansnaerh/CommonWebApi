## This is my Javascript In The Browser - Common Web APIs project.

The website is a note taking application that saves your notes in the local storage.

You can add, edit and delete your notes and the information will be saved to the local storage.

I followed the requirements for this project and this should meet them all.

The url will change when you press start and back. I didn't mess with the server-side code so if you refresh the page you will get an error. If that happens just enter the original surge url again.

Link to live version = jagged-teeth.surge.sh
